# Travel BucketList

## Description
A web database for users to store details of countries and cities visited, and those they wish to visit.
This project was built using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL. 

‘My Travel Bucklist’ allows users to:
- track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited
- add new countries to their bucketlist and edit them
- add and remove cities from countries in the bucketlist, and mark them as ‘visited’ or ‘to visit’
- add photos or images to cities


<!-- you should add a readme, it should contain the following -->
<!-- 1. context to the program, what is this, when did you do it, what are the technoglies used/what is needed to run the app-->
<!-- 2. some screen shots of the app, even better a youtube video, even even better host it online but that's like a whole project of it's own -->
<!-- 3. a _STEP_ by _STEP_ guide on how to get the app running-->
<!-- 4. add a seed  file so if someone wants to checkout your app they have some data to work with-->
